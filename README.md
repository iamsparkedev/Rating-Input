# Rating-Input
`PJ 01`
# A Rating Input program made in Go 
how it works -
1. first it takes the user input using bufio reader
2. Becuase the rating input is still a string thats why | :- converte it to int using strconv
3. remove the `\n` using strings package
4. if there is no err then complete the action.
